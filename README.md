# sd18spring-Text-Mining-MP3
I made a program that lets the user paste in links to Project Gutenberg text
files, saves those files under a name that they enter, then add those files to
a similarity plotter. There are already 10 works saved right now, so run
text_mining.py, and enter 0 to start, so that you can paste in this link:
https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16/16-0.txt (this is a link to Peter Pan).
After you specify what you want to save it as, continue running the program,
add the filename that you just saved peter pan under, and follow the remaining
prompts (I would recommend leaving the beginning and ending string prompts
blank, as the default setting handles Gutenberg books). Once you plug that in
you will see a similarity cluster of 11 books, all labeled. The program also
does not add duplicates, so if you want to try it with and without common English
words just rerun the program and enter in the same information as you did before
but with the final option switched.
